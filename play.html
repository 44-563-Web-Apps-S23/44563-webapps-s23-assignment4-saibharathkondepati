      <h6>HEROINE.</h6><p>[_To_ COMEDIAN.]</p> <p>But you let go my hands.</p> 

<h6>COMEDIAN.</h6><p>I think it's you who are holding fast to mine.</p> 

<h6>HEROINE.</h6> <p>Why should I be holding you? If you pick up the dollar, what is
yours is mine, you know.</p>

<h6>COMEDIAN.</h6><p>Then let go of my hand and I'll pick it up.</p> 

<h6>HEROINE.</h6> <p>No, I'd rather pick it up myself.</p>

<h6>COMEDIAN.</h6><p> I expected something like that from you.</p>

<h6>HEROINE. </h6><p>[_Angrily._]</p><p>Let go of my hands, that's all.</p>
