        They are ragged and weary. The COMEDIAN _walks first, holding a valise<p><br>

<p>COMEDIAN. Stepping toward the sign-post, reading the directions on the
boards, and explaining to the approaching fellow-actors.</p><br>
<p>VILLAIN Who will lend me a hand to wipe off my
perspiration? <p></p><br>
<p></p>COMEDIAN. Stand on your head, then, and let</p><br>
<p>VILLAIN. Oh! He drops his arms, the bundles fall down. </p><br>
<p>TRAGEDIAN. [_In a deep, dramatic voice._] It's hopeless! It's hopeless!
[_He lets go his end of the trunk._</p><br>
<p>"OLD MAN." [_Lets go his end of the trunk._] Mm. Another stop.

     [TRAGEDIAN _sits himself down on the trunk in a tragico-heroic
     pose, knees wide apart, right elbow on right knee, left hand on
     left leg, head slightly bent toward the right_. COMEDIAN _puts down
     the valises and rolls a cigarette_. The "OLD MAN" _also sits down
     upon the trunk, head sunk upon his breast_.</p><br>
<p>VILLAIN. Thirty miles to the nearest town! Thirty miles!</p><br>

<p>COMEDIAN. It's an outrage how far people move their towns away from us.<br></p>
